# nx-chat

A self-contained, reusable chat block. Designed to be mounted by Browse and Edit views without either knowing about the other.

## How to mount

```js
const chat = document.createElement("nx-chat");
container.append(chat);

// Inject view-specific context and callbacks via properties
chat.context = { org, site, path, view }; // view: 'browse' | 'edit'
```

The component manages its own controller internally. No external wiring needed.

## Properties in

| Property   | Type      | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages` | `Array`   | Conversation history. Read-only from outside — controller owns writes. |
| `thinking` | `Boolean` | Agent is processing. Disables input.                                   |
| `context`  | `Object`  | Page context: `{ org, site, path, view }`. Required — set by the host view. `view` must be `browse` or `edit`. |

**Message shape:**

```js
{ role: 'user', content: string }
{ role: 'assistant', content: string }
{ role: 'tool', ... }  // filtered from display automatically
```

**Request body:** The controller POSTs `{ messages, pageContext, imsToken, room, sessionId }` to the agent. `sessionId` is a UUID scoped to the current conversation session — it resets when the user clears the chat. Selection context is embedded on individual user messages (see [Selection context](#selection-context)) rather than as a top-level request field.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `chat.addAttachment({ id, label, ...rest })` | Adds a pill above the textarea. `id` is required — duplicate ids are silently ignored. `label` is the display text. Any additional fields are forwarded to the agent as context alongside the next message. |
| `chat.clear()` | Clears conversation history and writes a fresh `sessionId` for the current room. The new session ID takes effect immediately for subsequent agent requests. |

**Current scope:** `addAttachment` supports simple content references — e.g. a block or element from the document editor. Binary file attachments (images, uploads) are not yet supported and will extend this same API when introduced.

**Pills display:** All attached pills are currently shown with vertical scroll capped at two rows. Collapsing overflow into a "+N more" control is pending UX mocks.

## Events in

Components that want to add pills without holding a direct reference to the chat element can dispatch on `document`:

| Event | Detail | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `nx-add-to-chat` | `{ key?, id, label, ...contextFields }` | Adds or replaces a pill. If `key` is set, replaces any existing pill with the same key (use for selection-driven context that changes as the user moves focus). If `key` is omitted, appends a new pill regardless. Dispatching `{ key }` with no `id` removes the pill for that key. |
Context fields on the detail (`blockName`, `innerText`, `proseIndex`) are forwarded to the agent as selection context on the next message. See [Selection context](#selection-context).

**Setting a prompt programmatically:** Call `setPrompt(text, { autoSend? })` directly on the `nx-chat` element. Within DA Live, prefer dispatching `nx-open-chat-panel` on `document` instead — this also ensures the chat panel is open before the prompt is set:

```js
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('nx-open-chat-panel', { detail: { text, autoSend } }));
```

**Extension iframe usage:** Extensions running in cross-origin iframes cannot dispatch document events directly. Use `actions.setPrompt(text)` or `actions.setPrompt(text, { autoSend: true })` from the DA SDK — the iframe protocol relays it to `nx-open-chat-panel` on the host document, which opens the panel and calls `setPrompt()` on the chat element. `actions.setPrompt` is available on the object resolved from `DA_SDK`.

## Selection context

Attached context items (canvas selections, browse file selections) are serialised onto the outgoing user message before being sent to the agent:

```js
{ role: 'user', content: string, selectionContext: [item, ...] }
```

### Item shapes

**Canvas block** — emitted by `canvas-chat-bridge.js`:

```js
{ proseIndex: number, blockName: string, innerText: string }
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `proseIndex` | Zero-based editor index from `data-block-index` |
| `blockName` | CSS class name of the block (e.g. `hero`, `columns`) |
| `innerText` | Text content of the block |

**Browse file** — emitted by `browse-chat-bridge.js`:

```js
{ blockName: string, innerText: 'Selected repository path: org/site/path' }
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `blockName` | Filename with extension (e.g. `about-us.html`) |
| `innerText` | `"Selected repository path: ${key}"` where `key` is the full `org/site/path` |

### Agent-side handling

`selectionContext` is stripped from messages before the model sees them. `formatSelectionContextForModel` on the agent expands each item into text prepended to the user message — using `blockName` as the item label, `innerText` as the body, and `proseIndex` as the editor index hint. Items with no recognised fields are shown as "Prose section (editor index: ?)".

> **Contract:** The item shapes above are the shared contract between da-nx (client) and da-agent (server). If da-agent changes how `formatSelectionContextForModel` parses item fields, the bridge files (`canvas-chat-bridge.js`, `browse-chat-bridge.js`) and the `sendMessage` filter/map in `chat-controller.js` must be updated to match.

## Agent stream contract

The controller consumes a server-sent event stream from `da-agent`. Each line is a JSON object with a `type` field. The UI depends on the following event types:

### Text events

| Type | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `text-delta` | `delta` / `textDelta` / `text` | Incremental text chunk — appended to streaming buffer |
| `text-end` | — | Flush streaming buffer as a committed assistant message |
| `finish-message` / `finish` | — | Stream complete |
| `error` | `errorText` / `error.message` | Stream-level failure — terminates the stream immediately. Distinct from `tool-result` with `output.error`, which is a tool-level failure and non-fatal (stream continues). |

### Tool events

> **Contract:** Canonical field names are `input` and `output`. Legacy aliases (`args`, `result`, `tool-input-available`, `tool-output-available`) are accepted by the client for backward compatibility — producers should emit canonical names only.

| Type | Legacy alias | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tool-call` | `tool-input-available` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `input` | Agent invoked a tool. Legacy field alias: `args` → `input` |
| `tool-approval-request` | — | `toolCallId`, `approvalId` | Tool requires user approval. `toolName` and `input` are **not** included — the client recovers them from the prior `tool-call` event with the matching `toolCallId` |
| `tool-result` | `tool-output-available` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `output` | Tool completed; `output.error` signals failure. Legacy field alias: `result` → `output` |

### Tool card states

A tool card transitions through these states as events arrive:

```
tool-call → running
tool-approval-request → approval-requested  (or → approved directly if auto-approved)
(user approves) → approved → done
(user rejects) → rejected
tool-result (success) → done
tool-result (error) → error
```

`approval-requested` is the only state that requires user action. All other states are informational.

### Tool event ordering guarantees

Within a single stream connection, events for a given `toolCallId` are expected to arrive in order: `tool-call` first, then optionally `tool-approval-request`, then `tool-result` as the terminal event. The client state machine depends on this ordering — a `tool-result` arriving before `tool-call` would produce incorrect state.

> **Contract:** Event ordering per `toolCallId` is a stable contract with da-agent. Breaking changes require a coordinated update on both sides.

**Duplicates:** Should not occur within a stream. The client ignores a duplicate `tool-call` for an already-known `toolCallId` — subsequent events for that id are still processed normally.

**Missing `tool-result`:** If the stream is interrupted, a tool card may be left in `running` or `approval-requested` state indefinitely. `running` is in-memory only and resets on page load. `approval-requested` messages are persisted — `loadInitialMessages` filters incomplete approval sequences on reload to avoid sending unresolved tool-calls to the agent on the next request.

**Reconnect:** The stream is a live feed — events are not replayed on reconnect. A new stream starts fresh; any in-flight tool state from the previous connection is lost.

The approval popover accepts keyboard shortcuts: `Esc` = Reject, `↵` = Approve, `⌘↵` = Always approve.

**If the agent team adds or renames event types, `processEvent` in `utils.js` must be updated to match.**

### Approval summary rendering

The UI picks one field from `input` to display as a human-readable summary beneath the tool name. Priority order:

1. `humanReadableSummary` — preferred; plain-language description of what changed (used by `content_update`)
2. `sourcePath` + `destinationPath` — rendered as `sourcePath → destinationPath` (used by `content_move`)
3. `path` — file path being created or deleted (used by `content_create`, `content_delete`)
4. `skillId` / `name` — identifier for skill/agent creation tools

`content` and other large payload fields are intentionally excluded — they are never shown to the user.

For new tools that require approval, prefer adding a `humanReadableSummary` field to the input schema rather than relying on the fallback chain above.

`tool-result` output is stored in the tool card but not currently rendered. If da-agent adds a `humanReadableSummary` to tool output, it would be the natural place to show a completion summary (e.g. "Created `/drafts/page.md` successfully").

### "Always approve" scope

When the user clicks "Always approve", the tool name is added to an in-memory `Set` on the controller. Subsequent `tool-approval-request` events for that tool are auto-approved via `queueMicrotask`. The set is **conversation-scoped** — it resets only on `clear()`. There is no path-scoping: "always approve" applies to the tool by name regardless of what path the agent acts on, since the path is in the tool input rather than the tool name. There is no cross-session persistence.

## Persistence

Conversation history is persisted in IndexedDB, keyed by `org--site--userId`. This means:

- History is **shared across all pages within a site** — navigating between paths does not start a new conversation.
- History is **user-specific** — different IMS users on the same site have separate histories.
- `clear()` resets the stored history for the current room and generates a new `sessionId` — the record is updated rather than deleted so the new session ID survives a reload.

### Sessions

Each conversation has a `sessionId` (UUID) stored in IndexedDB alongside its messages. The ID is shared across tabs on the same room and survives page reloads. A new ID is generated on first open (no stored record) or when the user calls `clear()`. The agent receives `sessionId` on POST so it can scope server-side state to the current session and combine traces to a session for telemetry.

**Not yet implemented:** multiple named sessions per room, session switching UI, and agent-emitted `session-title` events. When introduced, the session picker and create/rename/delete UI would live inside the chat component — the host has no role in session management.

## Events out

| Event | Bubbles | Detail | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nx-agent-change` | Yes | `{ scope: 'file' \| 'document', paths: string[] }` | The agent completed a tool action that changed content. `scope: 'file'` means the file tree changed (files created, deleted, moved, or copied); `scope: 'document'` means a document's content was modified. `paths` contains the affected parent folder paths. |

## Skills slash menu

Typing `/` in the chat input opens a skill picker populated from the current site's skill library.

**Source:** `GET /config/{org}/{site}` → `json.skills.data` rows (same endpoint as prompts). This mirrors `da-agent/src/skills/loader.ts` exactly, so the menu only shows skills the agent can resolve.

**Rules (match the agent's `loadSkillsIndex`):**
- Site-level only — no org-level fallback.
- Rows with `status: 'draft'` are excluded.
- IDs are normalised: `.md` suffix stripped (`check-heading.md` → `check-heading`).

**Wire:** on selection, the skill ID is collected and passed as `requestedSkills: [id]` in the next POST to da-agent. The agent loads the full markdown content from its own config KV and injects it into the system prompt — the client never sends the content itself.

**Approval continuations:** `requestedSkills` is intentionally re-sent on approval continuation POSTs. The agent rebuilds its system prompt from scratch on every request, so the skill must be present in each POST that expects it to be in context. `requestedSkills` resets to `[]` only when the user sends the next fresh message.

## Boundaries

- **UI (`chat.js`)** — rendering only. No API calls, no auth, no view-specific logic.
- **Controller (`chat-controller.js`)** — agent communication, message state, persistence. No DOM access.
- **Host view** — mounts `<nx-chat>`, injects context and view-specific callbacks as properties. Never reaches into chat internals.

View-specific callbacks (e.g. document revert for Edit) are injected as properties on the controller — not as component properties. The view owns what to inject; chat owns how to use it.
